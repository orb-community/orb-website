==Orb== is a new kind of ==observability platform== that makes it easier for operators and developers to gain a deeper understanding of their networks, distributed applications, and traffic flows in real time. 

![](./img/ORB-diagram2.png)  

Orb integrates with your observability stack, providing dynamic orchestration of observability agents that extract business intelligence at the edge. The platform is completely [open source](https://github.com/orb-community/orb), extensible, vendor neutral, and cloud native.

## The components

### The agents

Orb manages ==observability agents== that collect network data from applications, systems, and edge locations (VMs, containers, servers) in real time. An agent acts as a sensor installed next to a data source so it can collect, analyze, and summarize information. You run agents on your edge locations and orchestrate them via the control plane.

While ingesting a high volume of information-dense data streams, the agents translate this information to deliver consumable, actionable datasets. Developers and network operators can view this data locally at the edge via the agent's command-line interface (CLI) and globally in a central database via a standard dashboard tool, such as Grafana.

### The control plane

Orb combines concepts from edge computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and high-throughput stream processing.

As an IoT-inspired cloud ==control plane==, Orb connects a fleet of distributed ==observability agents== (such as the [open source pktvisor](https://github.com/orb-community/pktvisor/)) deployed at the edge and gives you command over that fleet. In operating the control plane, you issue instructions to the agents, dynamically programming and re-programming them with data-collection policies to build different datasets in real time.

## The features

Orb orchestrates network observability policies across a fleet of agents on the edge—providing you with lightweight, immediately actionable results.

* Plugs into popular observability stacks, like Prometheus and Elasticsearch, as well as cloud storage and data pipelines
* Built using a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture
* Offers a self-hosted (via Docker Compose or Kubernetes) or a SaaS option

Orb focuses on edge analysis, preferring “small data”-style, actionable metrics over the collection and storage of terabytes of raw, inscrutable data.

* Allows you to visualize and automate on data at the edge for a hyper-real-time local view or centrally in the cloud for a global view
* Streamlines data collection and exporting back to the control plane where it is available for analytics, security, automation, etc.
* Provides a single pane of glass across all sensors

## Orb + pktvisor

Via ==Orb's user interface==, you decide *what data* to extract from *which agents*. The resource-efficient, side-car style ==[pktvisor](https://github.com/orb-community/pktvisor) observability agent== performs edge analysis on network data streams.

This combination allows you to:

* Adjust analysis and collection parameters dynamically across the entire fleet via a powerful control plane
* Perform centralized fleet management, allowing you to configure heartbeats, tagging, and grouping for each of the pktvisor agents
* Orchestrate dataset policies that specify the type of data to extract from each agent

In terms of metrics, pktvisor can capture DNS, DHCP, and L2/L3 network data via packet capture, `dnstap`, `sflow`, among other input methods.

For a complete list of metrics currently collected by pktvisor, look [here](https://github.com/orb-community/pktvisor/wiki/Current-Metrics).

## Core Concepts

The concepts below comprise Orb’s architecture.

### Agent

This is a ==sensor== installed next to a data source at the edge so it can summarize, analyze, and collect information.

### Agent group

This is a ==list of simple key/value pairs that match against agent tags== to dynamically define a group of agents. For example, “region: US” will group all agents in the fleet that have this key/value set in their tags.

### Fleet

This is a ==collection of agents== that may be widely distributed and number in the tens, hundreds, or thousands—all of which are able to connect and contribute to the same observability system.

### Policies

These are instructions sent to the agents to ==define how to collect metrics==. It is backend-specific information needed at the edge.

### Dataset

These are instructions that describe how specific agents in the fleet (matched according to a given agent group) should ==apply collection policies and where they should sink their data==. Orb will manage many datasets concurrently.

### Sinks

This is where you send the data. This is the system that collects the data and allows you to ==sync it to different locations==. Currently, Orb supports Prometheus but will support more backends in the future.
