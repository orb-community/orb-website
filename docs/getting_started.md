## Deploy your first Agent

Follow the steps below after logging in to the Orb Portal to get an Orb agent up and running.

### Create Agent Credentials
 
You create a set of agent credentials for each node you want to monitor. Agents are organized by tags. Each agent has a set of corresponding credentials used during provisioning. You may also [provision agents directly at the edge](documentation/running_orb_agent.md#advanced-auto-provisioning-setup) instead of through the UI.  

1. Navigate to ==Agents==, and then click ==New Agent==.  
![Agent List View](./img/new_agent.png)
2. Fill in an *Agent Name* and click ==Next==.  
3. Optionally, fill in *Key* and *Value* tags, then click the ==+== on the right side of the menu. These tags represent the way you will assign the agent to an agent group. Reasonable tags might be "location", "region", "pop", "type", etc.  
![Add tags to the agent](./img/new_agent_tag_add.png)  
4. You should see an icon with your key and value tags appear above the *Key* and *Value* textboxes. Click ==Next==.  
![Agent tag detail](./img/new_agent_tag.png)  
5. Click ==Save== to confirm your agent‚Äôs name and tags.  
![Save your agent](./img/new_agent_tag_save.png)  
6. Your agent credentials should appear. Copy the *Provisioning Command*. This command contains all the information you need to run the Docker container with the given credentials you now have for the agent.  
![Provisioning Command](./img/provisioning_command.png)  

### Start your Agent

!!! warning

    To connect an agent to the [self-hosted development control plane](/documentation/install/#self-host), disable TLS verification using the enviromental variable below in your provisioning command:
    
    ``` shell
    -e ORB_TLS_VERIFY=false
    ```

    Check an example [here](/documentation/running_orb_agent/#sample-provisioning-commands).

7. Run the *Provisioning Command* into a terminal on the node where you want your agent to run. See [Running Orb Agent](documentation/running_orb_agent.md) for more details.
8. Close out of the *Agent Credentials* menu. Refresh the *Agents List* in UI. The agent you just created should display an *Online* status.  
![Agent List: agent online](./img/agent_online.png)  
9. Optionally, click the agent's name to view the *Agent View* screen. This screen will contain more information as you add the agent to an agent group and add corresponding policies and datasets.  
![Agent View](./img/agent_view_agent.png)


## Configure your Agent

### Create an Agent Group

Agents are organized into agent groups based on key-value tag matching.

1. Navigate to ==Agent Groups==, and then click ==New Agent Group==.  
![Agent Group List](./img/new_agent_group.png)  
2. Fill in an *Agent Group Name* and click ==Next==.  
![Name the group](./img/new_agent_group_name.png)  
3. Fill in the *Key* and *Value* tags,
    ==which need to match the tags of the corresponding Agent==, and click the ==+== on the right side of the menu. 
    You should see an icon with your key and value tags appear above the *Key* and *Value* textboxes.  
![Agent Group Tags](./img/new_agent_group_name_plus.png)  
4. Click ==Next==.  
    You should see a message about the number of agents matching. Then click ==Save==.  
![Review Agent Group](./img/new_agent_group_name_next.png)  
By clicking in ==EXPAND== you can see the agents that are matching with the group (This is optional).  
![Group Matching Agents](./img/new_agent_group_expand_matching.png)  
5. View the newly created group in the ==Agent Groups== list.  
![Agent Group List](./img/agent_group_list.png)  
6. View Matching Agents  
    Click the number in the *Agents* column to view the matching agents.  
![Group Matching Agents Detail](./img/matching_agent.png)  

### Create a Sink

A sink is a location to send the metrics collected from the agents. The current version supports OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) and Prometheus.

=== "Try Orb with OTLP üî•"

    You can use a free [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/send-data/otlp/send-data-otlp/) account as a sink.

    1. Navigate to ==Sink Management==, and then click ==New Sink==.  
       ![Sink List View](./img/new_sink.png)
    2. Fill in a sink name and set sink backend to Otlphtp.
        - Optionally, add a description and sink tags by filling in the *Tag Key* and *Tag Value* fields. Click ==+== after each key-value pair.
    3. Fill in your sink destination details and click ==Create== .  
       ![Save Sink](./img/sink_save_2.png)
    5. View your newly created sink in the *All Sinks* list.  
       ![Sink List View](./img/new_sink_list_2.png)

=== "Prometheus"

    You can use a private Prometheus instance or use a free [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) account as a sink.

    1. Navigate to ==Sink Management==, and then click ==New Sink==.  
       ![Sink List View](./img/new_sink.png)
    2. Fill in a sink name and set sink backend to Prometheus.
        - Optionally, add a description and sink tags by filling in the *Tag Key* and *Tag Value* fields. Click ==+== after each key-value pair.
    3. Fill in your sink destination details.  
       This includes the host/username/password from your Prometheus `remote_write` configuration.
    4. Click ==Create== .  
       ![Save Sink](./img/sink_save.png)
    5. View your newly created sink in the *All Sinks* list.  
       ![Sink List View](./img/new_sink_list.png)


### Create a Policy

Policies tell agents which metrics to collect and how to collect them.

1. Navigate to ==Policy Management==, and then click ==New Policy==.  
![Agent Policy View](./img/new_policy.png)  
2. Fill in a policy name and (optionally) a description and tags.  
    - The policy name needs to be unique and cannot contain spaces (use underscores or dashes instead). Then click ==Next==.
![Name your policy](./img/policy_name.png)
3. You can start using the suggested policy. Click ==Next==.
    - In this policy, *tap* (input stream) is ‚Äúdefault_pcap‚Äù which is the default for Packet Capture. *Handlers* specifies how to analyze the input stream selected and, in this case, we want to analyze DNS and Network (L2-L3) traffic.
    - For a more tailored observability policy to filter on specific traffic or to add (or exclude) specific metrics, please refer to the [Orb Policy Reference](/documentation/advanced_policies).
![Save Agent Policy](./img/policy_setup.png)
4. Click ==Save== to save the policy.  
![Save Agent Policy](./img/policy_save.png)  

### Create a Dataset

Datasets essentially connect all the previous pieces. By creating and defining a dataset, you send a specific *policy* to a specific *agent group* and establish a *sink* to receive the resulting metrics which allows you to visualize and action on the data.

1. Navigate to the ==DATASETS== tab in Policy View
    - Navigate to `DATASETS` tab in the policy you would like to create a Dataset for, then click on New Dataset.  
![Dataset Creation from policy view](./img/new_dataset_from_policy.png)
2. Select the Agent Group and Sink(s) and click ==Create==
    - The policy will be sent in real time to the Agents in the Agent Group and begin running. 
![Select Agent Group](./img/new_dataset_modal.png) 
### Verify policy running
- Navigate to ==Agents== and click on the name of the agent that matches the group you selected in creating the dataset. <br> The *Agent View* screen displays under the *Policies & Datasets* tab information about your policy and dataset. Your policy must have a <span style="color:green">**running**</span> status. 
![View Dataset](./img/agent_view_dataset.png)  

## Check Orb Health

Orb objects have variables status whose functions are to help you understand the health of your system. A guide on how to interpret this is provided below.

### Agent Status

There are 4 expected status for agents: `new`, `online`, `offline` and `stale`

![Agent Status](./img/agents_status.png)

These status are related to the agent's last activity (heartbeat):

üü£ `new` means that the agent never sent a heartbeat (i.e. has never connected to the control plane)

üü¢ `online` means that the agent is sending heartbeats right now (is running and healthy).

‚ö™ `offline` means that the control plane received a heartbeat saying that the agent is going offline.

üü† `stale` means that the control plane has not received a heartbeat for 5 minutes (without having received a heartbeat stating that it would go offline)

### Policies Status

The status of each policy can be seen on the preview page of an agent to which it is applied

The policy will be:

<span style="color:green">**running**</span> if agent policy is being managed from the control plane (policy-related metrics are being requested/scraped by this agent)

<span style="color:red">**failed_to_apply**</span> if an error prevents the policy from being applied by the agent. By clicking on the expand icon you can see the cause of the error

<span style="color:grey">**offline**</span> if the policy was stopped by agent request

![Policies Running and Failed](./img/policies_running_and_failed.png)

![Policy Offline](./img/policy_offline.png)

### Datasets Validity

Once created a dataset can only be `valid` (üü¢) or `invalid` (üî¥)

![Dataset Status](./img/datasets_status.png)

The dataset will always be `valid` as long as the policy, the group *AND* the sink linked to it exist in Orb. If the policy, the group *OR* the sink is removed from Orb, the dataset will become `invalid`. Note, in the image above, that the invalid dataset does not contain the group listed, as it has been removed from the Orb.

### Sinks Status

üü£ `Unknown` - No metrics have ever been published to this sink

üü¢ `Active` - Metrics are actively being published to this sink

üü† `Idle` - The last metrics published to this sink were more than 5 minutes ago

üî¥ `Error`  - The sink tried to publish the metrics but failed. ==Attention==: In this case, check that the sink credentials are configured correctly.

üîµ `Provisioning` - Intermediate status which means that the sink collector is being provisioned.

![Sink Status](./img/sink_status.png)

## Visualize and alert on your metrics

* Your agent should now be running the policy you created. After one minute of collection time, the metrics will be sent to your Prometheus sink.
* You may use standard tools for visualizing and alerting on your Prometheus metrics. A popular option is <a href="https://grafana.com" target="_blank">Grafana</a>.
* A pre-made dashboard for visualizing Orb/pktvisor metrics is <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14221" target="_blank">available for import here</a>.
