### Check Orb Health

Orb objects have status variables whose functions are to help you understand the health of your system. Below is a guide to the correct interpretations of each status.


#### Agent Status
There are 4 expected status for agents: `new`, `online`, `offline` and `stale`

These status are related to the agent's last activity (heartbeat):

ğŸŸ£ `new` means that the agent never sent a heartbeat (i.e. has never connected to the control plane)

ğŸŸ¢ `online` means that the agent is sending heartbeats right now (is running and healthy).

âšª `offline` means that the control plane received a heartbeat saying that the agent is going offline.

ğŸŸ  `stale` means that the control plane has not received a heartbeat for 5 minutes (without having received a heartbeat stating that it would go offline)


#### Policies Status

The status of each policy can be seen on the preview page of an agent to which it is applied

The policy will be:

<span style="color:green">running</span> if agent policy is being managed from the control plane (policy-related metrics are being requested/scraped by this agent)

<span style="color:red">failed_to_apply</span> if an error prevents the policy from being applied by the agent. By clicking on the expand icon you can see the cause of the error

<span style="color:grey">offline</span> if the policy was stopped by agent request

#### Datasets Validity

Once created a dataset can only be `valid` (ğŸŸ¢) or `invalid` (ğŸ”´)

The dataset will always be `valid` as long as the policy, the group *AND* the sink linked to it exist in Orb. If the policy, the group *OR* the sink is removed from Orb, the dataset will become `invalid`. Note, in the image above, that the invalid dataset does not contain the group listed, as it has been removed from the Orb.


#### Sinks Status

ğŸŸ  `Unknown` - No metrics have ever been published to this sink

ğŸŸ¢ `Active` - Metrics are actively being published to this sink

âšª `Idle` - The last metrics published to this sink were more than 5 minutes ago

ğŸ”´ `Error`  - The sink tried to publish the metrics but failed. **Attention: In this case, check that the sink credentials are configured correctly.**
