# Visualizing Metrics

### Visualize and alert on your metrics

1. Your agent should now be running the policy you created. After one minute of collection time, the metrics will be sent to your Prometheus sink.
2. You may use standard tools for visualizing and alerting on your Prometheus metrics. A popular option is [Grafana](https://grafana.com).
3. A pre-made dashboard for visualizing Orb/pktvisor metrics is [available for import here](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14221).
