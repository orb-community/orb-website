## Introducing Orb

**Orb** is a free, open source tool developed at [NS1](https://ns1.com/labs) to improve visibility on the network edge.  
**Orb**'s unique "small data" approach dramatically lowers the cost of data collection, storage, and analysis across decentralized networks.

### Understand

Improve network performance by quickly pinpointing the source of misconfigurations and malicious activity

### Troubleshoot

Shorten time-to-action and lower costs by analyzing activity and dynamically applying policies right on the network edge

### Orchestrate

Simplify network management with automated deployment, centralized policy enforcement, and easily configurable dashboards

### Integrate

Save time and effort by streamlining your data pipeline, all with a tool that takes just ten minutes to start using

## Where Orb fits

The world is awash in observability tools. Orb is different because it focuses on the network edge - dynamic, distributed environments where resources are at a premium but the impact on end user experiences is high.

Orb is designed to integrate seamlessly with modren observability stacks. It minimizes the grunt work of building a data pipeline while producing the real-time, actionable intelligence you need from the network edge.
