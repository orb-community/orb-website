### Introducing Orb

The world is awash in observability tools.  **Orb** is a free, open-source tool that focuses on the network edge—dynamic, distributed environments where resources are at a premium, but the end-user impact is high. **Orb** manages a fleet of agents which tap into traffic streams and extract real-time insights on the edge. The result: faster time-to-action at a lower cost.

### Where Orb fits

**Orb**’s unique “small data” approach dramatically lowers the cost of data collection, storage, and analysis across decentralized networks. It is a free, open-source software released under Mozilla Public License (MPL). It can be deployed to any Kubernetes service in a private or public cloud. It does not depend on any single vendor to function. 

You can host **Orb** yourself, or run it through a hosted SaaS platform at <a href="orb.live" target="_blank">orb.live</a>.
